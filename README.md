# SeroConnect
## Introduction
Most of us have gone through periods of stress, anxiety, loneliness and depression. During those challenging times, many of us 
would have wished to have someone to talk to or just a confirmation that we are not alone. SeroConnect was basically created with those particular users in mind.
It provides users with a forum that enables them to talk about their problems freely and even anonymously. SeroConnect has podcasts and videos that speaks about 
mental health and advices the user on how they can handle their problems better.
